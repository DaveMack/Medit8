<h1>About</h1>
<p>Medit8 is a non-profit organisation dedicated to teaching the community how to
 improve their life through meditation and find the happiness they didn't know they
 were missing. We focus on techniques and stratergies to find time in your buisy life
 for meditation and rely solely on the donations of generous previous students which
 means we offer our courses completely free!</p>
<br/>
<p>Our school is located in an area of incredible natural beauty and is kept tucked
 well away from the humdrum of modern life. We offer a number of courses with a 10
 day course for beginers and 3, 10 and 30 day courses for more experienced students.
 All our courses are run by previous students and our staff are all vounters who have
 dedicated time to help with running the school. All courses are kept gender segregated
 to ensure your time is free from distraction and accomodation and parking is provided.</p>
