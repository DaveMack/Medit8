	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>The vision of Medit8 is a humane, balanced, inter-global community of 
	compassionate and awakened individuals.The mission of Medit8 is to 
	offer understanding, realization, and embodiment of the teachings of 
	the Buddha integrated with a modern, progressive scientific perspective.</p>
	
	<p>Welcome!  We are a community of people interested in Buddhism 
	and meditation.  We regularly meet to learn about the Dharma and 
	meditate under our qualified teachers. What students appreciate most 
	about the school's teachings is the incredible clarity, detail, and 
	depth of knowledge that he brings to teaching meditation and Buddhism. 
	Medit8 is a non-profit organisation and we rely solely on the 
	donations of generous previous students which means we offer our 
	courses completely free!</p>
	
	<p>Our ashram is located in an area of incredible natural beauty 
	and is kept tucked well away from the humdrum of modern life. 
	We offer a number of courses with a 10 day course for beginers and 3, 10 and 30 day courses for more experienced 
	students. All our courses are run by previous students and our staff are all 
	vounters who have dedicated time to help with running the school. All courses 
	are kept gender segregated to ensure your time is free from distraction and 
	accomodation and parking is provided.</p>
